want to build a next-level portfolio website using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion with crazy animations like:

Scrolling text reveal
Parallax effects
Magnetic cursor & mouse hover effects
3D transformations & interactive UI
The portfolio should feel like an immersive experience, combining smooth interactions, scroll-triggered effects, and dynamic content.

🔹 Sections to Include in the Portfolio:
🔥 Hero Section (First Impression Matters!)

A bold animated introduction with my name and title.
A 3D parallax effect when users move their cursor.
A typing effect or glitch animation on my profession (e.g., "Frontend Developer | UI/UX Designer").
A cool CTA button (e.g., “Let’s Connect” with hover distortion).
🎭 About Me (Storytelling Approach)

Use scroll-triggered text reveal for an engaging introduction.
Add interactive SVG illustrations with motion effects.
Display skills as animated cards that rotate on hover.
🚀 Work Experience & Projects (Showcase with Style!)

Horizontal scroll effect to reveal project cards.
Hover effect where images zoom and tilt slightly.
Custom cursor effect that changes when hovering over projects.
On click, open a modal with an animated project preview.
🎨 Skills Section (Make It Visually Engaging)

Animated skill bars or circular progress indicators.
Grid layout with hover effects (e.g., hover to reveal the tech stack).
Text fade-in effect as users scroll.
🌎 Testimonials & Achievements (Build Trust)

Carousel animation to slide testimonials dynamically.
Hover-triggered flip cards showing detailed feedback.
3D hover effects on award icons & certificates.
📞 Contact Me (Make It Interactive!)

Large heading text reveals letter by letter on scroll.
Use clip-path animations for smooth effects.
✔ Parallax Effects:

Background images move slower than the scroll speed.
Layered parallax to create depth.
✔ Magnetic Cursor & Hover Effects:

Cursor snaps towards elements when hovering.
Text & buttons slightly distort when hovered.
✔ GSAP & Framer Motion Magic:

Use Framer Motion for smooth, spring-based animations.
GSAP ScrollTrigger for timeline-based scroll effects.
✔ Glassmorphism & Neomorphism UI Elements:

Frosted glass effects for modern design.
Soft shadows & embossed buttons for realism.
🛠️ Tech Stack for Smooth Performance:
Reactjs
Tailwind CSS – Easy styling & utility-based design.
Framer Motion & GSAP – For smooth animations.
SHadcn For Components
🚀 Final Goal:
A stunning, animated, and highly interactive portfolio that stands out, impresses visitors, and makes a lasting impact. It should feel modern, responsive, and fast while incorporating cutting-edge UI/UX trends.
